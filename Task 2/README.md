## Task 1

Imagine a simple company that has two types of employees - Engineers and Salespeople. We will use classes to test how it works. Primitive Testbench will be out on Wednesday, June 5.

- Follow the instructions in the comments to complete the employee database in `people.py`
- Properly define the queries in `main.py` 

### Some things to keep in mind
- The problem statement is very loosely described to encourage questions. Feel free to point out discrepancies in the code
- Ye college assignment nahi hai! I will help you solve things you find tricky. But do approach stackoverflow and google first.
- Feel free to use AI tools as long as you know what you're doing.
